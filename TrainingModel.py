    ["""in 2010 Intel launched something truly extraordinary the first user upgradable processor the Pentium g69 51 and thank goodness they did because now just a short 13 years later I'm finding it a little sluggish for my daily Computing and I can't wait to unlock hyperthreading and that sweet sweet megabyte of extra cash only little confused here I've got Windows 7 then I've got my upgrade card I just can't seem to find the Intel upgrade program uh hi Intel what do you mean you don't offer upgrade service for my CPU anymore this is a more common situation than you might think where you buy into a service or a hardware product that has add-ons available only to discover that one day when you go to use them they vanished without so much as a oh sorry about that why does this happen who is responsible and is there any justification for this business practice the only way to know is apparently to scan this barcode to our sponsor MSI msi's back to school sale is on now looking for a new laptop for next semester they got those what about a desktop PC yep got those too components for an upgrade yeah they do got them check out msi's back to school sale below there's no question that the G6 951 was bad but that doesn't mean that all Hardware as a service products are equally bad extended warranties for example can be costly but if they're fairly priced and you read the fine print they can be an effective way to ensure that your expensive TV or laptop will be serving you for years to come even if something goes wrong then there's service contracts which are kind of like extended warranties on steroids that net apppp storage appliance that we picked up recently ly comes with ongoing maintenance costs which sucks for your wallet but ensures that your business won't experience unnecessary downtime another example of Hardware with ongoing costs that make sense is anything that requires periodic calibration like a home theater projector or a scientific instrument our colorimeters for testing displays for example need to be checked and certified against a known good or you wouldn't be able to trust our results in all all of these cases though the after purchase costs at least add potential value to our Hardware let's shift gears back to the Pentium G nice 51 for a bit though here's how Intel's pitch went back in 2010 you could pick up the chip either by itself or in a system from let's say Best Buy and out of the box you'd have two cores and two threads running at 2.8 GHz all for the attractive price of just 90 bucks which yeah that's not actually that cheap but hey that's what happens when one half of your duopoly is busy seeing how many Winchester rounds it can fire into its own foot don't worry about that though said Intel for when you get tired of your entry level performance you can simply purchase a card with an unlock code on it for 50 more dollars here is obviously fake but the idea was that you would scratch the scratch card film install Intel's activation software plunk in your code and Bam you just doubled your red count from 2 to 4 and added extra cash all without ever breaking out the thermal compound or a screwdriver it's pretty good thing these things didn't take off or how would I sell these things LTT store.com but why didn't it take off I mean on the surface it's actually kind of a cool idea it did come with some big problems we'll touch on later but first the supposed benefits a major one is the theoretical lack of e-waste think about all the GT 1030s out there they start their life on the Shelf they end up in your computer until inevitably they're too slow and ultimately end up at the recycler If instead we just had fewer products within the stack physically which could then have performance features turned on or off based on the price you paid we'd have a lot more one card fits-all Solutions this would also alleviate the need to purchase a brand new product when you want a performance uplift you could just just save up a few bucks and Abracadabra your 4050 is now a 4060 TI how cool would that be I mean knowing Nvidia that would still be an expensive upgrade but socially anxious people around the world would Rejoice over not having to list their old card on Facebook marketplace hegle with some jackass sell it then go pick up a new card from the local retailer it's kind of like a layaway except you get to use the cheaper but worse product while you wait to afford something better don't get me wrong though guys I can I can hear you shouting at me through the screen if the product can physically do X then that capability should be unlocked out of the box and to be clear I agree with you but there are a plethora of situations where we accept these kinds of practices already look at nvidia's workstation gpus for example they are often literally the exact same Hardware as their consumer ones but they might include features or especially certifications that cost Nvidia extra time and money certifications that will only be used by a small subset of their customers so those customers who care get to pay extra and there was a significant amount of backlash against me when I called out Tesla for pay Walling the heated rear seats in the model 3 I mean my argument was hey the hardware is present in every single unit that Tesla builds so if they can afford to deliver it to the people who don't pay for it then surely they can afford to just include it but the reasons that they do that are because it streamlines production at the factory and then they just kind of massage the pricing so that the people who do want that feature subsidize those installs for the rest of the people who don't and even though again for me I was like really many Tesla owners were stoked on being able to just change their mind later and activate the feature so it is an idea that can work without taking off your customers but that is not the sentiment that surrounded our little Pentium here for one thing the value of this product was uh pretty questionable I mean why buy this thing at all when you could have gotten a core I3 530 a chip that includes hyperthreading by default for just $25 more and making matters worse the upgrade was actually tied to the motherboard so if you wanted to sell the upgraded version of your CPU down the line good luck that also means that if your motherboard happened to die or you wanted to replace it with something with more IO you would have to request a new activation code and rerun the upgrade cuz yeah that's the first thing I want to do after changing up my motherboard thanks Intel of course that's a relatively minor issue compared to what we encountered which was the inability to perform the upgrade at all I mean sure this is a 13-year-old CPU that is not getting security updates anymore and realistically nobody wants to spend 50 bucks to make it ever so slightly less slow but Intel actually discontinued this program well within the reasonable lifespan of this product just three short years later what recourse do we have when companies especially publicly traded ones are f ickle profit hungry entities that can alter the deal on us at a moment's notice let's look at another example that's from Intel but today earlier this year they announced that vck virtual raid on CPU which is an Enterprise raid Solution that's featured on Zeon scalable processors would be discontinued but then 4 days later oems were advertising v-rock support on freshly announced products so which one is it Intel they did quickly backpedal and say ah the feature is under evaluation and uh since there's a significant demand we'll continue to support it but it's like someone's head was on the chopping block and the Executioner raised his axe and it was only because someone noticed and went oh wait hold on don't chop off that head that it got a short stay of execution I mean until when Intel personally I'm also just tired of this post sales nickel and diming did you see the that GM is dropping support for Android auto and apple carplay that's right soon they're going to be using their own flavor of Android automotive which is completely integrated within the vehicle nothing to do with your phone and it'll be complete with subscription services and potential micro or who knows macro transactions all so they can keep their hand in your pocket after the initial sale and potentially gets even worse the support timelines on Android automotive are certain generous compared to what we get in our phones supposedly in the 10 to 15 year range but this is a car I expect it to last longer than 15 years before it just oh yeah sorry I guess you're just uh not getting software updates anymore ongoing Revenue models like subscriptions aren't always just bad I mean people used to Pirate the heck out of adobe's Creative Suite because they wanted Photoshop and Lightroom but they didn't want to spend thousands of dollars on a onetime license well now you can get them for 10 bucks a month which is a lot more reasonably priced for smalltime creators the flip side of that though is companies like ours who need a lot of licenses for years on end well it obviously sucks for us because we don't necessarily need the new features that they're developing and we would have actually preferred to just buy the software once and use it until Adobe releases a feature that really compels us to upgrade we made a whole video about that a little while back and the truth is I don't really know where I'm going with this um I'm not sure if anything that I'm saying is going to change anything I just want us all to be on the same page that if we don't do something if we don't make noise if we don't stop supporting the companies who engage in these business practices we will end up in a dystopian future where suddenly your GPU underclock itself because you forgot to pay your monthly bill to Team Green or on a whim your gaming console could decide oh uh that online store that we had well that's closed because it's much more profitable to sell our backat catalog on a new console at a higher price than to just leave the old one open oh wait that's that's already totally a thing oh hopefully I haven't given Nvidia any ideas for the future as for today anywh who um unfortunately our Pentium g69 51 will remain a g69 51 and never reach its final form the g69 52 sorry little guy you're stuck like this with no hyperthreading like this non hyper segue to our sponsor delete me companies are passing around your

supported by a standard PC but USB has a dark secret as it turns out the real world limit is actually much much lower and the only way to find out what it is for sure is to just start plugging devices in which oh well I mean I guess we could just read the white paper on the architecture of the spec but that would be far less interesting for the people watching on YouTube so instead we're just going to start plugging things in and see what happens what do you do once you run out of ports I mean hubs obviously but can we just keep plugging in Hub after Hub after Hub until we hit it what is it and what is the Segway to our sponsor the ridge looking for a stylish and practical wallet the ridge wallet has got you covered its minimalist design allows you to carry your essential cars and cash without the bulk so check it out at the link below and use code Linus to save 10 off your purchase and get free shipping the first factor that limits how many USB devices you can connect to your computer is one you know quite well and that's the number of ports on the front and back of your PC but what you might not know is that most computers only have a single USB host controller and all of those ports are going to share not only that controller but that controller's bandwidth so when you have a USB 5 gigabit per second Port it's five gigabit per second shared with all the other ports on the controller now fortunately hitting a bandwidth limit is pretty uncommon most peripherals like mice or keyboards use a negligible amount of bandwidth however you can run into odd behavior if you have say for example a video capture device or a webcam this was really common with early generation VR headsets where the VR tracker sucked up so much bandwidth that users needed to install a second controller on an add-in card of course our question today isn't how much bandwidth can we push through one of these controllers it's how many devices can we connect to one so let's move beyond the limits of our mirror mortal rear i o ports I summon The Hub I haven't even plugged the Hub in yet and I think we're already getting kind of weird Behavior none of these whoa whoa this mouse is crazy hot wait heatedmouse.com oh it's a feature all right people unpowered hub now a mouse hey there it is Logitech gaming mouse now another Drive ah but this is interesting every Hub is actually two hubs see that we've got a USB 2 Hub and a USB 3 Hub and depending on what kind of devices we plug in they'll show up under either hubs like this one are an integral part of the various USB specifications they handle all the communication between devices that are plugged into them and the host systems that they're plugged into as well as handling bandwidth sharing the Hub will tell the system hey I'm a hub and the system adds that hub's address to the path of any devices that are plugged in down the chain when multiple hubs are used multiple addresses are added to the path so if Hub a for example is plugged into Port 4 of the host Hub B is plugged into Port 2 of Hub a and then a mouse is plugged into Port 1 of Hub B the address might read something like 0421 or 0 is the address of The controller's Root Hub powered or unpowered it doesn't change the addressing system however according to the USB spec a hub that is powered entirely by the port that it's plugged into like this one cannot allow this sort of daisy chaining according to the spec anyway as we are about to see however that is not the case here right look at this but why though because unpowered hubs are liars sometimes actually not just sometimes most of the time and if that shocks you well it shouldn't consider their predicament according to the spec only low power devices so devices that draw less than 100 milliamps are supposed to be used on hubs that are powered by the port itself and not by an external power brick so if people buy a spec compliant unpowered Hub they're going to be in for a rude shock when many of their devices I mean even mice with too many RGB lights won't work for some unclear reason so as a result manufacturers can either have mostly happy customers and with an out-of-spec product or they can have USB implementer Forum certification well Average Joe customer doesn't care about usb if certification they might not even know that they exist whose Castle is this they just want a hub that works with their devices and it usually will however draw too much current and your USB controller will shut down the connection from The Source hopefully before anything gets damaged should we try that why don't we plug the heated Mouse into this thing okay working now but what happens when we turn our heat to high oh wow this is still working somehow I need more power how about this k95 keyboard really how is this all still working at more brightness that was Max brightness let's plug into a USB 2 port that'll do it and really were you expecting this to work I mean no not really but time for another RGB keyboard two full RGB keyboards and a heated Mouse do we have any bigger unpowered hubs no these are the two unpowered hubs I could find most of our stuff seems to just be powered and it's plugged into a USB 2 Port which means that it's pulling at most two and a half Watts which is crazy that all that stuff just works okay what I suspect is that this motherboard is just like um I will deliver more than spec unbelievable I can't believe they just allow more power draw so that things function properly this will do it heated Mouse RGB keyboard and stream deck no it doesn't have the software is this I want it to light up full brightness oh wait hold on USB device not recognized last USB device you connected has malfunctioned yes we've overwhelmed it wow wow what the devil is that she real unhappy I suspect if we plug this directly into the back of the PC a H it would show up just fine Elgato stream deck XL there it is everything working perfectly but we take it back out of here and we plug it into our unpowered hub and boom problems suck says [ __ ] point is there's a solution to that powered USB hubs like this one from sabrinth that does a whopping 16 devices now something funky about these is that they are power mandatory hubs some are power optional remember that first one that I had over here it actually has a barrel Jack so it can operate as a powered Hub this one on the other hand is like uh-uh no can do where's my cable zip zilt NADA but plug in a 90 watt charger and hey there we go all right this is interesting we're going to talk about this later all the different hubs that are present here but first let's see if we can get our stream deck and our heated Mouse and our RGB keyboard running at the same time we gotta turn on those ports of course with these I can greatly expand my USB connectivity all I have to do is daisy chain my Hubs together which should give me pretty much Unlimited hubbery uh except for one small problem too many USB hubs a hub will not function when it's connected more than five hubs away from the root Port but this is only three hubs remember when we noticed that each of these one hubs was identifying as five hubs in software sort of okay USB hub chips can have up to seven Downstream facing ports or dfps most Hub chips have only four dfps so a manufacturer looking to make a big tough USB bar that doubles as a self-defense weapon could achieve their desired number of ports by doing what anyone else would by chaining them together this particular model from sabrin has one main chip with four dfps that each branch off into four more chips with four more dfps each that gives us a total of 16 ports Each of which are two hubs deep so if we put three of these together that's six hubs in a row of course all of this Hub into Hub tomfoolery was just an excuse for me to talk about Hub depth limitations the real way to plug in is many devices as we can is to plug each of our hubs into the back of our PC now we're only two hubs deep on every one of these ports meaning we can start loading things up I could use a couple of extra hands here boys I'm actually going to turn these off just so that I can do this we're not going to be able to use USB thumb drives forever though Windows gets kind of fussy about how many Drive letters a little signs so I'm just going to do one Hub worth of these start bringing over mice yeah why don't we have a mouse Hub a USB thumb drive hub and a keyboard Hub what do you guys think sound good we are up to 30 devices now and I gotta say good old USB you know we kind of take it for granted you know you just use it every day and don't think about it but it is shockingly robust are you guys um what are you guys doing with the keyboards over there uh we need to plug some in right now is what we need to do all right hit me with some cables cable plug these two in better believe it we've made it to 48 devices all of which are showing up correctly and while there is some weird Behavior Uh I can't click sometimes for example yep that's uh hold on maybe a different Mouse we'll click no um how about this no no that doesn't work but uh what about the Windows key oh uh control shift Escape hello oh yeah about uh could bring up task manager so that's good alt f4 anything buddy shoot okay let's go just One keyboard and one Mouse for a sec here why was I able to click on that one thing and not a different thing this is so weird okay yes we're back and come back all my pretties okay excellent now I have another hub there is a point to this we're on a different screen now and I'll show you why this is important let me just get everything lit back up here first it's at 1 14 right now we're at 172. uh uh this is not what I was expecting to happen but we have a total of 234 endpoints um Tanner yeah that's not what we were expecting to happen is it not at all I haven't found so much as a data sheet for a USB Root Hub that can handle more than 128. it's supposed to fail at 127. well 128. um it did not apparently the AMD chipset is just very powerful when it comes to the amount of USB it can handle yes more devices Tanner what is it supposed to do uh it's supposed to tell you that it's out of resources I see and were you ever actually able to create that condition tons of times cool it became something I could do in less than five minutes on both my laptop and the system I was testing on I see those are both Intel based systems and for some reason AMD just decided to go ham on the amount of USB they can handle starting with am4 but back then it was still limited to 128 and I expected it to be at least somewhere near 128 still but no it what are we at right now 304. let's go World new world record some of hubs and devices is 101 right now we are getting dangerously close to the goal we set out at the beginning of the video and we haven't even pulled out the USB innator yet I will be very disappointed if I don't need this it's a theoretical limit of xhci is like 8 000. but how often do we reach theoretical limits for these things I haven't been able to get anywhere near it without things breaking and yet here we are with AMD just tanking it surely this final Hub will be enough he said not really convinced ah this video is completely off the rails now there were rails there was a script there was a plan weeks of testing and then we just happened to grab an AMD system 106. remember because there's five hubs in here right plus the one thing I replugged back in uh okay I'm just gonna start finding plugs and plugging them into things why thank you good sir 337 endpoints wait oh oh we just lost a bunch we're down to 270 endpoints all of a sudden the keyboards are dead whoa we are losing devices left and right here did we just completely oh wow they're coming back okay wow this is not what you want to see well cool at any rate here's screen capture of the normal way that this happens that Tanner will get later and this is also a thing that can happen when you have too many endpoints allow me to explain it's not a device limit or a power limit or a bandwidth limit this is an end point limit an end point is a data pipe between the host and the device and a device will typically have multiple endpoints for things like configuration occasional small low latency data transfer non-time critical large data transfer and continuous data flow for things like microphones or cameras now remember when I said that well they're all buried now but these hubs were actually five hubs well that was half true they are five USB 3 hubs and they are also five USB 2 hubs for a total of 10 hubs each Hub uses two endpoints for a total of 20. now technically xhci extended host control protocol supports up to 31 end points per device which assuming a reasonable 127 device limit like we encountered in our testing is nearly 4 000 endpoints that's enough endpoints to fill up a tech Sac from ltdstore.com but you're not going to be able to actually hit that limit with Modern Hardware because controllers almost always have a limit of 64 to 128 endpoints typically settling on around 96 except that this one didn't it had like over 300 or something but that doesn't matter because we are still going to get to our goal of plugging in 128 devices with the USB animator it should actually behave less flakier than this maybe don't make promises you can't keep the one with all the USB drives in it is flipping hot like unhappy wow ow you know it kind of is a good representation of the difference in philosophy between Intel and AMD Intel has a tendency to just say this is what we know we can support reasonably well and just know you actually may not have any more than that whereas AMD tends to be kind of more YOLO like I don't know see what happens we're not going to put a limit on it what you are looking at here is an Asus mining motherboard not because we're doing any Bitcoin mining or anything like that but because we want a whole bunch of pcie by one slot plugged into a whole bunch of these little mining daughter boards that instead of being loaded up with graphics cards are loaded up with USB controller cards in total I believe we have 30 total USB controllers meaning that we are going to be nowhere near any kind of endpoint limit Shenanigans to get to our 127 devices from the outside the usbnator is very similar to what we were just doing we've got the sabrant 16 Port hubs and we're going to plug them into ports in the back of our computer but it's these ports that make this system different Star Tech sent over two different kinds of USB controller cards these ones with seven plugs and these ones with four and believe it or not the ones with four plugs are actually better than the ones with seven and that's because and if you've been paying close attention you'll know why this matters four of these ports namely the top ones are running off of an integrated Hub meaning that it would be much easier to hit an end point limit using these so for example if you had a couple more multi-port hubs and then one of these multi-display adapter things it would work in any of these bottom three which are directly connected to the controller but would cease to work if it was connected to one of the top four that is not true of our four port cards each of these is running off of its own controller meaning that the theoretical maximum number of endpoints going into just one of these cards would be 508 or something like that assuming each of these can do 127 endpoints what that means is that if all goes according to plan it should be basically impossible for us to reach an end point limit on this system I say we power the thing on all right because the first thing that we need to do is uh is verify which of these cards currently feels like working ah it's not the card's fault it's the risers right mining stuff definitely reliable oh so reliable this one has no lights yeah this one has no lights that's okay I can work with that I regret taking the approach we did last time why how many total drives did you say that you could handle as many as there are letters in the alphabet but really the problem is when a whole bunch of them connect at the same time then Windows tries and give tries to give the drive letter to multiple drives at once sick it is time to painstakingly plug in 127 USB devices how are we doing here how are we doing for endpoints boys oh we're we're at 56 total peripherals end points are going to be just based on the controller itself so we've got multiple controllers but yeah we're at 56 56 and 122 standard hubs not bad let's do more we are up to 86 peripheral devices the question is are they still functioning at all let's do my caps lock test so you should be able to kind of see them going going nuts okay what about the Windows key wow okay with all these controllers it's actually still kind of working can I can I click on something yes very nice more thumb drives I am uh I'm getting kind of nervous about the lean going on here like that is that is some pizza level almost and there is a single strip of tape holding these on it's good tape but Ah that's 16 ports worth of stress we're at 100 devices right now 100 devices let's go I have to say my side much more organized I did take the only rack though yeah we have a mouse infestation 104 are any of these not lit up oh that's that heated one uh weirds me out man oh crap something is depressed uh oh sorry no no not that kind of depressed oh are some of the ports not powered or something not power on this okay no there's no exactly oh okay what are we up to now Colin 112. oh we're so close 113. come on that didn't count that also didn't count oh we're down we're down to 110. okay what about this one oh no oh no oh I just saw keyboard lose power I wonder if this is more of a driver level limit just trying to manage all of these flipping device what does our CPU usage look like look at my cursor now just hold on a gosh darn second here oh okay it's not exactly a super powerful CPU it's only a quad core but we were pulling 60 when I opened this and it's sitting at 30 40 percent now just doing nothing while I'm disappointed that we couldn't get to 127 concurrent devices we learned a lot along the way and in fact I have had multiple times in the past when I've run into issues that would have been caused by these kinds of topology limitations that just I didn't understand in the past and now I will so the main things to take away here are that if you're using a hub you're going to want to connect that directly to the root controller and if you're using an unpowered Hub hey it might be running out of spec so make sure you're only plugging in low power devices or get yourself a powered Hub we're down to 99 guys I think she kind of take it anymore just like I can I take it anymore not telling you about our

this space for anything else but not everyone's happy with this trend Paul's Hardware just posted a video criticizing rear mounted power connectors and he makes some pretty good points computers don't run on Magic so you still have to run cables from your power supply anyway there's no cooling benefit to this whatever the marketing might tell you and this could turn out to be a compatibility

more components including redesigned gpus and power supplies only time will tell if this is going to ultimately catch on or if full end up seeing any of it outside of China but it's definitely something to keep an eye on I gotta say if I was looking for a starting point this is pretty much where I'd want to be I would describe this as a premium mid-tier board it obviously uses a b650 chipset but it's got really robust i o including 20 gigabit per second USBC Wi-Fi 6E two and a half gig Lan and even a clear CMOS button super convenient it's got a robust vrm design and cooling so as long as MSI engineered the BIOS correctly any am5 CPU should run its best in here of course the star of the show is the rear mounted connectors which should give our finished build an extraordinarily clean look given the price of our board we're going to have links in the video description what we're aiming for today is a great pretty high end but also not Overkill build so we've gone with the AMD ryzen 5 7600x it's only twenty dollars more than the base 7600 now and I consider that a fair price for the nearly one gigahertz increase in base clock speed and it's just a great gaming chip with six super fast cores and support for the latest Technologies including pcie Gen 5 and ddr5 memory speaking of which we've gone with a g-skill flare X5 ddr5 kit at 6000 Mega transfers per second we had actually planned to stick with just 16 gigs but at a hundred dollars this 32 gig kit was less than 20 dollars more than a 16 gig kit at the same speed lordy has Ram ever gotten cheap lately and so has storage this two terabyte Corsair mp600 Pro would have been more than 200 at the start of the year now it's available for just 140 bucks or at least the not stupid air-cooled one is that that's the one we're using it didn't matter because we were going to strip the heatsink off it anyway to be clear there are a lot of good options out there for m.2 drives right now but we like this one's mix of price and performance along with course our solid reputation for being a trustworthy bro for their users with our nvme safely tucked away we can install our CPU Cooler we've gone with the noctua nhl12s but instead of the normal low profile fan ha ha um ah we've gone with this you might have seen this in our recent computex coverage this is the alpha cool Apex stealth metal fan it uses a patented decoupled design with separate housings O-rings and a plastic shroud that results in according to them anyway I haven't heard it yet a very low noise level they're totally modular and the zinc housing because this thing ever heavy is available in black white this gorgeous Chrome that's going to look great with our build you've heard it here first a special edition gold finish that they just told us about this morning these aren't out yet but they're coming soon and Alpha cool expects them to retail for 30 each stats a lot for a bang for the butt gaming PC but we're also trying to achieve a certain look here and that is just mwah uh oh here's something that didn't really occur to me we need an extension to plug in this fan which is fine but why would you have the connector for the CPU fan on the back then you just have to run it around to the back actually you know what a I still think this might be better I like it having the connectors on the back of the motherboard definitely um introduces some risk of stabbing now we know also I really want to rip off this daisy chain thing no there's no I'm taking it off no I'll do it properly though okay all right all right goodbye sorry goodbye daisy chain there we go hey nice and clean now oh yeah that's more like it not gonna have that daisy chain cable hanging off my CPU fan that looks this freaking awesome all of that brings us to our case the fractal pop mini air at ninety dollars is a well-built attractive Micro ATX case but that's not why we chose it see the thing is only a handful of cases are designed for the DIY ape connector scheme like this one behind me from Asus all those cutouts that's amazing so realistically then I would have taken just about any case that has ample space behind the motherboard tray where we're gonna have all those connectors coming out which raises a question why this you absolute madman you just showed us that you already have the perfect case for this build right there why aren't you using it ah the thing is that case like the other DIY 8 ready models is China exclusive meaning that if you're watching this video on YouTube you aren't going to be able to get one so the way that I see it it's only fair that I should share that same experience Plus I've already got the Dremel out Jordan you're the one who mapped out approximately where the connectors need to come through is that right that's right do you really intend for me to remove all of this all of that uh there's gonna be like nothing left just a little sliver of metal holding the motherboard tray into place that's why you want uh the case specifically designed for this generally never have second thoughts [Music] I'll take that face shield it's spitting a lot of Steel into my face [Music] it's not very white anymore is it you can fit so much clean build in this bad boy let's try blowing it out man just carrying it over here I got a nasty oh oh maybe there's hope for this yet that's how we do peels in the big time something yeah it's white again uh oh the motherboard tray surely there are no metal shards left in here that could short out our sensitive Electronics and cut open our sensitive hands uh is there a plan for that yeah we got some gasket material to put around those holes so you're not going to cut yourself off this is not perfect it might be better than nothing though it's just this little kind of u-channel gromedy stuff here uh it definitely looks better than the heat destroyed raw edges screw it let's just put the motherboard in okay um yeah sure oh you know what that totally worked uh I yeah I didn't really like the sound of that either oh it could be related to my fan cable here hold on no no no wait wait wait hold on dude it's all good oh oh it's in this hole doesn't really line up which got me thinking you know gee what's up with the tolerances on this case because all these back ones do I think when we cut it it might have affected how it sits a little so we're gonna have these are gonna be uh structural screws attached to a structural motherboard and almost nothing else needs to go in here except the big GPU that's going to ruin everything of course what we haven't addressed is the situation at the back it looks like we almost have enough clearance to plug fan connectors in here almost I need to do some finagling there everything else though looks like we almost nailed it oh uh oh what's jfp2 here because it's covered covered in a way that has a rubber grommet and won't short out that might also explain why the um this screw was hard to screw in it'll probably work right yeah the only way to know for sure is to plug in our power supply and see how it goes now before you rush to the comments and tell us about how this thing is overkill we ran into some logistical challenges for this video okay so we're using a seasonic snow silent 1050 watt power supply which pairs perfectly with these custom length cable mod cables that we happen to have kicking around in the warehouse if you were to recreate this build for yourself I would strongly recommend something more in the range of 750 to 850 watts and I would also recommend picking up something that is compatible with custom length cables because otherwise you're going to take your cable management problem in the front of the case and you're just going to move a cable management problem to the back of the case we want to have something that's not so long that we've got a whole bunch extra to hide back here and this is actually looking like it might close uh how sure are we that this back side panel is going to close Jordan uh 80 from here that is very low um I feel like oh what was that that was a motherboard tray that is not very strong anymore letting go I think wait what happened oh this screw came out like just totally came out maybe one of them somehow is 6 32. this isn't a brand new case it's been used before so maybe somebody screwed up and put the wrong standoff there that's what I'm hoping for and that is in fact what it was oh good okay sign up for a notification for when we get the knock to uh color scheme screwdriver okay this isn't the noctual one but you guys get the point editor cleverly replaced this with the noctua one in my hand hey that one two different color schemes you know what though this is great for making videos I was just standing here thinking now I have now I have to round and do this and I'll do that no now I have to just stand here and plug in all the connectors this is awesome that is a wow that is a very high profile connector yes they do make right angle adapters for that whoa no way no way no way past Linus or realistically past Alex probably bought this no way this way no no no no no no that's okay that's okay that's okay that's okay see we're gonna come down like this oh yeah not bad at all that just saved the day I mean how uncool would that be nice a nice cable-free system too bad none of the ports work not gonna lie this is tripping me out a little bit though I just don't know which way is up and which way is right and I'm in topsy-turvy land uh my front panel audio thing is here because that makes perfect sense yep in Mirror reality and I don't know Paul I think I might kind of like it how's the underside of that bus Paul wow that is so clean and I didn't even have to do that much work on the cable management back here okay I mean we needed this special adapter other than that pretty easy okay wish me luck everyone how about good luck no it needs to be good luck you don't wish people bad luck luck of any form okay hey that is sick and other than getting your hands on the motherboard all you need to recreate this build is a few dollars in Dremel cutting discs oh and you'll probably want to change the power supply to a more reasonable one and you'll probably want to change the GPU see the thing is we wanted to use a Radeon 6950xt that thing is a flipping awesome value right now but again our choices were dictated a little bit by Aesthetics this gigabyte Aero RTX 4070 looks flipping awesome and that is the only real justification that we have for choosing this over the 6950xt truth is that it's kind of hard to justify any Nvidia card right now at least unless you're spending over a thousand dollars which we are not oh actually before we put this in this is another really cool idea from ape instead of having this 16 pin connector out here where it's gonna stick out and look all gross he had the idea of hiding it in between the fins here so it just kind of like I don't know it was hidden kind of ingenious because of the ease of this build we haven't gotten as much overhead footage from our Mexico camera up here as we otherwise might have but this is a pretty good opportunity the m.2 cover had to come off and the Order of Operations here is very important so about that's going to go there then this is going to go back on with this removed whoops this is going to go here nice oh yeah oh yeah yeah yeah I mean as far as ugly cable messes go that's pretty acceptable hey that is not bad okay all right I'm okay with it if that's all the cable that I have to look at in my system forget about it check this out look how heavy that freaking fan is just hitting the tables like whoa it's as quiet as they say it is though I'm looking forward to hearing it or not hearing it what do you think Colin is it gonna post oh that's a good sign oh wait what security violation but oh okay all our memory is detected CPU turboing over five gigahertz comfortably there is something we need to adjust we need to make sure that we have our XMP profile enabled but otherwise it's full builds and oh good that big security error was just because we had this plugged in and TPMS enabled so it got really unhappy that we were trying to boot from this USB drive don't love the amount of work it was but I love this computer like wow I just want to do a quick cinebench here to see if we're going to get oh dude just freeze see that's the thing I wanted to do just a couple quick benchmarks and see if this thing performs as normal works as normal because small brand motherboards sometimes they don't turbo properly and stuff like that then again the whole bios was all MSI MSI branded and everything and oh oh it looks like it actually might have just been cinebench that crashed okay it's running again there is some weirdness Hardware info is not reporting core temperatures for some reason but it's turboing just fine we're running at 4.8 gigahertz and performance here looks totally in line with what I'd expect for 7600x maybe just don't overthink it for now how about games I don't know what's more impressive the fact that this thing just immediately worked exactly as expected or the fact that it is so flipping quiet right now we are turboing to five gigahertz right now our gpus at nearly three gigahertz and this whole computer is nearly silent my microphone's right here just whoosh you know what I'm really curious about though how much of it is the metal fan wow that does not sound like a fan that is spinning that fast and this is really impressive frequency makes it really easy to block out even with a glass panel I can barely hear it I really want to do something about the power connector on the GPU whether it's an additional slot at the back of the card like we've seen from Apple and Asus in the past or whether it's just hiding the connector better like ape suggested but overall this is a pretty clever idea that does make a clean build a lot easier well easier at least it is properly adapted case design ultimately then with the combination of a new motherboard standard that requires new case designs from case manufacturers and piling on the potential additional Innovations in GPU power supply and cooler design ape still has a long road ahead of him and getting this adopted but I wish him luck because Paul's ultimately right that not everyone wants to mod their case and we need someone anyone who has a Clear Vision to push this thing forward rather than leaving motherboard manufacturers to just pursue their own independent paths I mean that's why we still have front panel connectors that aren't standardized just like we have this Segway that isn't standardized to our sponsor Mexico the next ago Iris 4K AI webcam features a large 1 over 1.8 inch Sony starvis sensor that delivers crystal clear image quality for streaming video conferencing and content creation even in challenging light

of f 2.2 and a 4.2 millimeter focal length and with the 90 degree field of view and 10x digital Zoom you won't miss even the smallest details the Dual noise canceling mics also make sure that you're easily understood while the high-speed HDMI port delivers uncompressed 4K video direct to a record or capture card all the top footage you guys saw in this video went straight from our next to go Iris into our capture system on set over here so if you like what you've seen go ahead and check it out the regular price is 249.99 and right now you can get it for 30 off check out the details in the video description if you like this build check out our recent video where we got our hands on a beautiful custom PC that was built by another Billy Billy Creator around one of ape's other motherboard designs", "The new MSI b650m ape Wi-Fi motherboard has all the connectors on the back of the motherboard instead of the front. The new design is the start of the DIY ape revolutionary that will extend to many more components including redesigned power supplies."]
