this is real it's true
dude No One Believes us I know I know
they're saying to tweet it but what does
tweeting it have to do with anything let
me see
remove energy Banner if you're not on
org I'm still on the org contract wise
okay I'm still representing energy
questions but I'm not on the starting
roster comments concerns
is there any questions that you guys
would like FNS and I to answer okay let
me be more clear
the okay so after Champs ended I
genuinely was unhappy
for multiple reasons but I just wasn't
happy like there anymore
so it was best for both parties for me
to leave
and then
Sam left like shortly after
and then Sam approached me to just like
ask me what I'm doing and I told him I
don't know
and he said all right let's stream and I
said might as well give it a shot
because would we have such a long off
season
and then yeah so here we are it's true
so FNS deciding to leave Satchel out I
also dude these guys actually not cap
Chad I swear we swear on everything
voila
voila I'm streaming I'm gonna stream in
like 30 minutes I'm waiting for
something to come in
listen for during this off season
start and I decided we're just gonna
stream
because it's not like we're gonna
compete anyway during this off season
and if something comes up during this
off season or next year
then we'll see what we can do
but the plan right now is just to stream
and just there's no old optic coming
back I know that shit's happening or
maybe with a new igl but not me
uh
I'm not playing with that core P Chow 33
thing for six months whatever I'm
playing just just stream and then
wish them the best and then we chill
